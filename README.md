# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Before setting out to travel to another location, it is wise to check the weather at the given location accordingly to avoid any setbacks that can affect travel or plans. With this weather dashboard application, a user can input their city choice and check the current weather as well as the forecast in the next few days.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn about retrieving data from an API and using this data to present it on a unique applicaiton. For this project, OpenWeather API was used to retrieve the weather data from cities based on the user's input. 

## Resources used:
* Openweather API
* Bootstrap v4.5
* jQuery

## Improvements
While the search history is stored in the browswer, I would like to the work on loading the previous search item upon loading the webpage. 

UI can use some slight adjustments, specifically the five day cards. Also, I would like to work on loading the next five days in the dashboard as it will only load the next day's forecast at a random hour of the day.

Finally, I would to like to work on the syntax to display the UV index for the current weather forecast.
